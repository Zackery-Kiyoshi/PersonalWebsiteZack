                MERGE started with what is commonly known as the "purple foam cardboard headset", but unlike most mobile phone powered headsets it's designed for Augmented Reality (AR).
                There was also work on a 3DoF (3 Degrees of Freedom) bluetooth controller to allow for more then just the 2 button interactions that are built into the MERGE Headset.

                When I joined MERGE it was about a month before we officially launched the MERGE Cube. 
                Althought many of the apps and prototypes that I worked on never got into users hands. 
                I got to work with all of our external dev teams and helped many of our 3rd party devs with both our MERGE Cube SDK and general help in the development process.

                When ARKit and ARCore were initially released we saw the changes that it would make in the landscape. 
                It allowed us to interact even more with the world with the MERGE Cube. 

                Not only did this allow us to explore the posibilities with the MERGE Cube but other products as well.
