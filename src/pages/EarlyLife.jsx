                Destination Imagination (DI) is a global, non-profit, volunteer-led educational organization that inspires and equips students from kindergarten to university with core 21st-century skills such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving. 
                How It Works: The program is a project-based learning experience where students work in teams of two to seven to solve one of several annual, open-ended STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) challenges. The core principle is "learner ownership," meaning that adults (Team Managers) can guide and teach skills, but the entire solution must be conceived and created solely by the students themselves, without any outside interference. 
                The challenges fall into categories such as:
                - Technical
                - Scientific
                - Fine Arts
                - Improvisational
                - Engineering
                - Service Learning
                - Early Learning (non-competitive) 
                Throughout the school year, teams work on their solutions, which culminate in a presentation at regional and state-level tournaments. Successful teams can advance to the annual Global Finals, the world's largest celebration of creativity. At tournaments, teams also participate in an "Instant Challenge," which requires them to think on their feet and solve a quick problem with limited materials. 
                Core Goals: The primary goal of Destination Imagination is to teach the creative process from imagination to innovation, preparing students to be the next generation of innovators and leaders. Participants build self-confidence, learn to take risks, develop a growth mindset, and gain the ability to work together effectively to solve complex, real-world problems. The program aims to create "a different type of learner: a learner who asks questions, a learner who is in control of their learning, a lifelong learner
