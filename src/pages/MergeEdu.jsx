                This section will describe the pivot to education, Merge Explorer, Merge Object Viewer, Creator,
                Scanner, and exploratory work with AI-driven content creation for the Merge Cube.

            <h2>Merge Explorer</h2>
            <p>
                Explorer was the first in our purly educational endevors. 
            </p>
            <h2>Merge Object Viewer</h2>
            <p>
                Although Explorer was our first fully educational app, along with Mr.Body and Galactic Explorer Object Viewer we had some edutainment apps. 
                Object Viewer was always designed 
            </p>
            <h2>Merge Creator</h2>
            <p>
                Although we allowed users to modify the objects material properties and sizes on different modes we originally did this mainly through a web editor. 
                Sadly this causes differences visually and having to store values for the web editor as well as the app. 
                So when we finally had time and we decided to fully drop support of the web editor we created Creator.
                Although we had some editing tools in Object Viewer before but we decided to keep it as a seperate experience as one for Creating your objects and viewing objects.

            <h2>Scanner</h2>
            <p>
                There are many different ways to get 3d models it can take time and may not be right. 
                For educators it can be even harder to make sure that its appropriate. 
                There are many different platforms for doing simple model creation but with AI and image processing tech that we have then we can create a 3d model from a small number of images.
                We thought why should we point users to another application to scan their objects when we can have them stay in our ecosystem and have their object immedietly available after processing.

            <h2>RND</h2>
            <p>
                Through out my time at MERGE I have gotten to work on various prototypes and new technologies. 
                One of the most interesting is using AI (Artifical Intelligenace) to generate 3d objects. 
                With this you can take a single image, a drawing, a picture. 
                Using this then anyone can create a 3d asset that
